'Parcel Calculator' is native Mac OS X application for calculating girth, volumetric weight and for tracking parcels. It is written in ObjC / Cocoa with extensive usage of Objective-C 2.0 sytnax. Newer technologies such as garbage collection require Snow Leopard (or higher) to work properly. Feature overview:

- calculation of girth and volumetric weight
- parcel tracking: DHL, DPD, FedEx, GLS, Hermes, ParcelForce, Royal Mail, UPS
- Direct Parcel Distribution (DPD) conformity tests
- Sparkle software update
- user preferences
- beautiful designed graphical user interface
- integrated help
- multi-language: English and German
- Open Source release under the FreeBSD license

What are these values for? The girth of an object is a measurement around it. It is often used by postal services and delivery companies as basis for pricing. The volumetric weight indicates how much space a parcel takes up in relation to its weight, charges for air freight are based on this value.

TODO: support for more delivery companies, additional tools, save parcel IDs for later reference

If you work with other operating systems, you might prefer 'pcp (Parcel Calculator Portable)', which is a command line variant written in portable C and aimed to compile on every conceivable platform. 'pcp' is also available here at GitHub.
